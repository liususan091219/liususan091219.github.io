  <h3><b>FAQ</b> </h3>

      <p>
        Q: I cannot attend a lecture, what should I do?
        <ul>
          <li>A: You are not required to attend every lecture. If you cannot make a lecture, there is no need to email the instructor and ask for leave. If you miss one class, please make sure to go over the slides and come to the instructor's office hours for any questions you have. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      </p>
        <p>
        Q: How are the quizzes graded? <br>
        <ul>
          <li>A: The quizzes WILL be graded; however, they are mainly for attendance and for reviewing what we learned in class rather than evaluation. We will have 10-15 quizzes and your final score for the quizzes is the average over the 8 highest scores you achieved.  </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Q: How to access the slides? <br>
        <ul>
          <li>A: The password to the slides can be found from the 'HOME' page in Canvas.  </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Q: How to get feedback on the quizzes/assignments/exams? <br>
        <ul>
          <li>A: The quizzes/assignments/exams will be graded by CAs. Your answer sheets for quizzes and exams will be handed back to you in class, so you can get the feedback. If you have questions, please first go to recitations and ask questions there, if you cannot make the recitation and you still have questions, please go to the instructor and CAs' office hours. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

<!--
<p><b>Important note: </b> It assumes a basic knowledge of the area such as the material covered by Computer Security I (CS 461). This semester it will expect ability to program in Java and C or C++.</p>


      <h3><b>Expected Work</b></h3>
      
      <p><b>Participation:</b> Students are required to attend all the lectures. Please inform the instructor and the TA via email if you cannot make it to the class due to travel or sickness. </p> 

      <p><b>Quizzes:</b> Students are expected to complete a short quiz within 24 hours after each lecture. The quiz contains 4-5 single-choice or multi-choice questions. The quiz is closely related to the respective lecture and is designed to be light-weighted (and hopefully fun) to improve student engagement during the lecture. Quiz is not graded --- students will receive points by simply trying them. </p> 

      <p><b>Machine Problem (MP):</b> Students are expected to work on 4-5 MPs throughout the semester. The projects will involve hand-on programming and data analysis, covering various topics that complement the lecture topics. Example topics include tracking user location based on social network data, interacting with Bitcoin APIs, multiple parties performing joint machine-learning without directly exchanging data. The list of project topics will be released later in Spring 2020. 
      </p><p><b>Survey paper:</b> This is for 4-credit student only. 
      </p>
