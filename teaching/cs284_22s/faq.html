  <h3><b>CS284 conversational agent</b> </h3>

      <br>
      <p>
        To help respond students' requests faster, we provided a conversational chatbot below. It is recommended to talk to this bot first. If your question is not solved, send an email to the instructor or the TA. <br>
      </p>

<!--
<p><b>Important note: </b> It assumes a basic knowledge of the area such as the material covered by Computer Security I (CS 461). This semester it will expect ability to program in Java and C or C++.</p>


      <h3><b>Expected Work</b></h3>
      
      <p><b>Participation:</b> Students are required to attend all the lectures. Please inform the instructor and the TA via email if you cannot make it to the class due to travel or sickness. </p> 

      <p><b>Quizzes:</b> Students are expected to complete a short quiz within 24 hours after each lecture. The quiz contains 4-5 single-choice or multi-choice questions. The quiz is closely related to the respective lecture and is designed to be light-weighted (and hopefully fun) to improve student engagement during the lecture. Quiz is not graded --- students will receive points by simply trying them. </p> 

      <p><b>Machine Problem (MP):</b> Students are expected to work on 4-5 MPs throughout the semester. The projects will involve hand-on programming and data analysis, covering various topics that complement the lecture topics. Example topics include tracking user location based on social network data, interacting with Bitcoin APIs, multiple parties performing joint machine-learning without directly exchanging data. The list of project topics will be released later in Spring 2020. 
      </p><p><b>Survey paper:</b> This is for 4-credit student only. 
      </p>
